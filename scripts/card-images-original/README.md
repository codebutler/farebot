# Original Card Images

This directory contains the original, unmodified source card images as they were before any processing (rotation, resizing, cropping, format conversion).

These are preserved so that transformations can be re-applied from clean originals if needed.

The images used by the app live in each transit module's `src/commonMain/composeResources/drawable/` directory and may have been:
- Rotated from portrait to landscape orientation
- Resized to a standard 600px width
- Converted from JPEG to PNG
- Cropped (e.g., sugoca front-side only)
- Replaced with higher-quality versions from external sources
